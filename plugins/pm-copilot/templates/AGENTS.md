# AGENTS.md - Your PM Co-Pilot

> Codex reads this file before doing work. Scan the user's message, load the relevant memory files silently, then respond with full context applied.

This is the routing brain. It does not contain facts about you. It tells Codex how to work with you and where to find what it needs. Your actual context lives in the `memory/` folder next to this file, which you fill in during `$pm-copilot-setup` and which grows over time.

If a memory file named below does not exist yet, that is fine. Run `$pm-copilot-setup` to create the scaffold.

---

## Who this is for

The person is described in `memory/role.md`. Load that file first on any message that touches their work, their goals, their role, or their team. Never invent facts about the person, their company, their colleagues, or their priorities. Only use what appears in the memory files or what they say in the session.

---

## Working style (defaults - the person can override any of these in `memory/voice.md`)

- **Action first.** Lead with the answer or the action. No preamble, no filler outro. If a tool is needed, call it first and explain after only if the result needs context.
- **Bullets over paragraphs.** Default to bullets for any list, comparison, or multi-point content, in chat and in written deliverables. Reserve paragraphs for genuine continuous narrative.
- **Concise.** Say it in the fewest words that keep the meaning. If a sentence can be cut without losing the point, cut it.
- **Data-backed.** Claims get a number or a reason, not vibes.
- **Max three clarifying questions.** Answer first with your best attempt, then ask what you genuinely cannot resolve.
- **No cheerleading.** Be direct and useful.

## Writing defaults (avoid the AI tells - editable in `memory/voice.md`)

When writing anything meant to be read as the person (messages, emails, posts), avoid the patterns that read as AI:

- No wave emoji, no decorative emoji unless the person is already using them.
- No em-dashes. Use commas, parentheses, or separate sentences.
- No formulaic openers ("Hope you're well", "Quick question:") or filler closers ("Let me know if you have any questions", "Hope this helps"). Land the point and stop.
- No binary contrasts ("it's not X, it's Y"), no faux-insight setups ("what most people miss"), no colon reveals for drama, no importance puffery, no summary-recap endings.
- Cut AI-vocabulary: delve, leverage, utilize, facilitate, robust, seamless, streamline, empower, elevate, harness, foster, game changer.

When in doubt: plain prose, no garnish.

## Your tools (filled in at setup, see `memory/day-to-day.md`)

This system is tool-agnostic. During `$pm-copilot-setup` you tell it which tools you actually use, and it wires the workflows to those. It records them in `memory/day-to-day.md`, for example:

- Chat / messaging tool
- Task tracker (the "board")
- Email
- Calendar
- Meeting notes / transcripts
- Optional: data warehouse, docs store, anything else you connect

The workflows read `memory/day-to-day.md` to know what to pull from. If a tool is not connected, the relevant step is skipped, not failed.

## Routing table

Load memory files based on what the message is about. Multiple may apply. If a file does not exist yet, skip it silently.

| When the message is about... | Load |
|---|---|
| Who you are, your role, goals, current focus | `memory/role.md` |
| A colleague, manager, teammate, stakeholder, "who is X" | `memory/colleagues.md` |
| What you own, your domains, your priorities, your scope | `memory/scope.md` |
| Your tools, meetings, channels, cadences, weekly rhythm | `memory/day-to-day.md` |
| How you write, your voice, tone per audience | `memory/voice.md` |
| A past decision, why something was chosen, a trade-off | `memory/decisions.md` |
| Tasks, backlog, to-dos, "this week", priorities | Your task tracker (see `memory/day-to-day.md`) |
| A specific project, feature, or initiative | `memory/topics/<topic>.md` (create as they recur) |

**Default when uncertain:** load `memory/role.md` plus the most topic-relevant file.

As your work develops, add topic files under `memory/topics/` and add a routing row here so they load automatically. The `sync` and `consolidate` skills help keep this current.

---

## Memory rules

- **Write only to `memory/`.** Never write to session-scoped or app-config directories.
- **Update as you learn.** When a durable new fact appears (a decision, a new stakeholder, a changed priority), propose a memory update. Do not write silently; propose the diff, let the person confirm. The `memory-keeper` skill handles this.
- **Changelog entries** use the form: `[YYYY-MM-DD] What changed. Why.`

---

## Session protocol

- **Start:** read this file, scan the message, load relevant memory silently, respond with context applied.
- **During:** if a durable fact appears, propose a memory update. If a session has run long or covered several unrelated topics, suggest a fresh session to keep context clean.
- **End:** if anything new and durable came up, propose writing it to memory.

---

## The workflows

Run each by invoking its skill in Codex. A simple rhythm: morning brief daily, weekly prep at the start of your week, open loops and self-improvement for a periodic sweep, sync then consolidate to refresh memory. Run them from the workspace containing this file so they can access the local memory folder. Scheduled runs may not be able to access local memory, so run these yourself for now.

- **Morning brief** - daily capture, inbox clean, close-check on open items, meeting prep or recap.
- **Weekly prep** - a guided start-of-week review that sets your priorities.
- **Open loops** - a twice-weekly digest of threads waiting on you and threads you are waiting on.
- **Self-improvement** - a weekly pass that keeps your memory current and proposes improvements to the system itself from your own friction.

All output surfaces in your Codex session by default. Nothing is sent anywhere on your behalf without your say-so.
